## About Me

Hello, welcome to my homepage! My name is Anni Li. I am currently a third-year PhD student at the [Control and Optimization of Discrete Event Systems (CODES) Laboratory](https://www.bu.edu/codes/people/) of Boston University advised by [Prof. Christos G. Cassandras](https://christosgcassandras.org/). I got my master degree at Applied Mathematics in 2020 from Tongji University advised by [Prof. Jitao Sun](https://math.tongji.edu.cn/info/1122/8339.htm). In the same year, I also worked as a research assistant at the [Smart City with Artificial Intelligence (SCAI) Lab](https://jamesyu.me/scai/) of SUSTech advised by [Prof. James Yu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=yujq3&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1). In 2017, I obtained my dual Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from Central China Normal University.

My research interests are  **control theory, optimization and machine learning with applications to connected automated vehicles.**
